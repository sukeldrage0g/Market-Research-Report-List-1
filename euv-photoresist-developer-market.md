<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EUV Photoresist Developer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist Developer</li><li>Negative Photoresist Developer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EUV photoresist developer market is primarily categorized into positive and negative photoresist developers, each serving distinct purposes in semiconductor manufacturing. Positive photoresist developers dissolve exposed areas of the photoresist layer after exposure to extreme ultraviolet light, allowing for precise pattern transfer. Conversely, negative photoresist developers harden in exposed regions, retaining the unexposed areas, and are favored for specific applications requiring more robust features. Both types are crucial for achieving high-resolution patterns in advanced lithography processes.</p></p>
